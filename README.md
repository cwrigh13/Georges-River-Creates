# Georges River Creates

[Georges River Creates](https://cwrigh13.github.io/Georges-River-Creates/ "Georges River Creates") is a single-page web application designed as an internal resource for staff at the Georges River Libraries. Its primary function is to serve as a centralised hub for accessing key information about items in the Digital Tool Library, Musical Instrument Collection, in-house kits and creative spaces. The application also includes an integrated global search bar to quickly find specific items and an AI assistant to answer questions based on pre-fed library policies and general information.

## **Features**

* **Single-Page Application (SPA):** The entire application is self-contained within a single HTML file for simplicity and quick deployment.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** A responsive, left-hand navigation menu with collapsible sub-menus allows for easy browsing of different categories.
* **Dynamic Content Display:** All content, including item lists and detailed landing pages, is dynamically rendered into a clean, top-aligned main panel.
* **Integrated Global Search:** A prominent search bar filters content across all library resources in real-time.
* **AI Assistant:** An interactive AI chat feature provides answers to policy and general questions using a pre-configured knowledge base.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is built with Tailwind CSS and adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
* **Simplified Data:** The application is designed to function with a mock data structure, making it easy to integrate with a real backend service like Firestore in the future.

## **Technologies Used**

* **HTML5:** For the core application structure.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** All interactive functionality is powered by plain JavaScript, encapsulated in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) to prevent variable conflicts.
